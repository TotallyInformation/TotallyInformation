ðŸ”­ In my very limited spare time, Iâ€™m currently working on [node-red-contrib-uibuilder](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-uibuilder). A really simple way to create data-driven web apps with the help of [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/), a low-code programming tool for creating event-driven applications.

Professionally, I am the IT Head of Architecture for NHS England. Check out our [IT Standards](https://nhsengland.github.io/it-standards/#/) repository.
